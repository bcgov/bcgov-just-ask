    JustAsk allows you to invite an employee or contractor working for the Province to join you in the BC Government's [BCGov GitHub organization](https://github.com/bcgov). This will allow them to create repos, submit pull requests, create issues, collaborate with other members and more. [See the full list of member privileges here.](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-peoples-access-to-your-organization-with-roles/permission-levels-for-an-organization) 

    ## Before inviting someone, make sure they:

    1. Have a GitHub ID. If you donâ€™t already have a GitHub ID, they can [create one here](https://github.com/).  
    1. Have an IDIR. Employees already have an IDIR, but contractors may need to get one. [Learn more about IDIR requirements on DevHub](https://developer.gov.bc.ca/docs/default/component/bc-developer-guide/use-github-in-bcgov/github-transition-guide/#compatible-idirs-for-contractors).

    [Invite member]({% raw %}{{ login_link }}{% endraw %})


    ## What will happen next

    * The invited user will receive an email with an invitation to join. 
    * Once they accept the request, they will need to log in to GitHub, and then follow the quick and easy prompts to link their account to their IDIR. 
    * Once their account is in the bcgov GitHub organization, you can invite them to join the repositories your team manages so they can make changes to that code. We recommend using [GitHub teams](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/organizing-members-into-teams/about-teams) to make this quick and easy to do.
    
    If they have not received an invitation to join within 1-2 hours, or if something goes wrong, you can post a message on Rocket.Chat ([#github-news-and-support](https://chat.developer.gov.bc.ca/channel/github-news-and-support)) or [request support](https://citz-do.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/2).
